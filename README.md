# Festa

A website for organizing events

## Develop

Run:

```console
$ yarn install
$ edit .env.local
$ yarn app:dev
$ open http://local.steffo.eu
```

> Sadly `http://local.steffo.eu/` points to a 192.168.1.* address, which means you won't be able to login anyways unless you have that exact same address :|

### Using Visual Studio Code

Configure your `.env.local` file, then run the `Everything!` run configuration.
